# Next.js Image Import Error in Dynamic Route Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where importing an image from a relative path within a dynamic route component in Next.js causes the entire application to break. The image import works fine in other pages.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when attempting to import an image using a relative path within a component rendered by a dynamic route.  This causes a build-time error or runtime failure, resulting in a broken application.  However, the same image import works as expected in pages that are not dynamic routes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that the application breaks when uncommenting the image import in `pages/about.js`

## Solution

The solution involves using the `Image` component from `next/image` for optimal performance and compatibility with Next.js's image optimization features.  Refer to `aboutSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights the importance of using Next.js's built-in image optimization features for robust application development.  Failing to do so can lead to unexpected errors and compatibility issues, particularly in dynamic route components.
